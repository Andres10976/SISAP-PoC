# CT Brand Monitor — Certificate Transparency PoC

A production-ready Certificate Transparency (CT) brand-protection monitor that watches public CT logs for newly issued certificates matching user-defined keywords. Automatically detects potential phishing attacks, domain abuse, and unauthorized certificate issuance for monitored brands.

**Tech Challenge Submission** — Full-stack TypeScript/Go application with REST API, real-time monitoring, reactive web UI, and PostgreSQL persistence.

## Setup/Running Instructions

### Prerequisites

Choose based on your preferred setup:

**Docker Compose (Recommended):**
- Docker Desktop or Docker Engine 27.0+
- Docker Compose 2.20+

**Local Development:**
- Go 1.23 or later
- Node.js 22 or later (with npm)
- PostgreSQL 17 (running separately, or via Docker)

### Quick Start with Docker Compose

The simplest way to run the entire application:

```bash
# Clone and navigate
git clone <repo>
cd SISAP-PoC

# Full stack: database + backend + frontend
docker compose up --build

# Application will be ready at:
#   Frontend:  http://localhost:3000
#   Backend:   http://localhost:8080
#   Database:  localhost:5432
```

This spins up:
- **PostgreSQL 17** database
- **Go backend** REST API (auto-waits for DB healthcheck)
- **React frontend** Nginx server with API proxying

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop. Use `docker compose down` to remove containers and clean up.

### Local Development Setup

Run services independently for faster iteration during development:

#### 1. Start PostgreSQL Database

```bash
# Option A: Docker Compose DB only
docker compose up -d db

# Option B: Use existing PostgreSQL 17 installation
# (configure DATABASE_URL below with your connection details)
```

#### 2. Start Backend API (Go)

In a terminal from the repo root:

```bash
cd backend

# Install/update dependencies
go mod tidy

# Run with default configuration
export DATABASE_URL="postgres://ctmonitor:ctmonitor_dev@localhost:5432/ct_monitor?sslmode=disable"
go run ./cmd/server

# The API will be available at http://localhost:8080/api/v1
```

**For Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
$env:DATABASE_URL="postgres://ctmonitor:ctmonitor_dev@localhost:5432/ct_monitor?sslmode=disable"
go run ./cmd/server
```

The backend automatically:
- Connects to PostgreSQL
- Runs database migrations
- Initializes the CT log monitor ready to start

#### 3. Start Frontend Dev Server (React)

In another terminal from the repo root:

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server with HMR
npm run dev

# Dev server runs on http://localhost:3000
# Automatically proxies /api → http://localhost:8080
```

### Testing

**Backend (Go):**
```bash
cd backend

# Run all tests (no database required — uses mocks)
go test ./...

# Run with verbose output
go test -v ./...

# Test single package
go test ./internal/handler/...
```

**Frontend (React + TypeScript):**
```bash
cd frontend

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test

# Run tests once (CI mode)
npm run test:run
```

### Database Setup

The database is automatically initialized on first run via embedded migrations. No manual SQL needed.

To manually reset the database:

```bash
# Option 1: Docker Compose
docker compose down -v pgdata  # Remove volume
docker compose up              # Recreate fresh DB

# Option 2: Manual reset (if using local PostgreSQL)
psql -U ctmonitor -d ct_monitor < /dev/null
dropdb -U ctmonitor ct_monitor
createdb -U ctmonitor ct_monitor
# Restart backend to run migrations
```

### Configuration

Configure the application via environment variables:

| Variable | Service | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Backend | **yes** | — | PostgreSQL connection string. Example: `postgres://ctmonitor:ctmonitor_dev@localhost:5432/ct_monitor?sslmode=disable` |
| `SERVER_PORT` | Backend | no | `8080` | HTTP listen port for REST API |
| `CT_LOG_URL` | Backend | no | `https://oak.ct.letsencrypt.org/2026h2` | Certificate Transparency log endpoint (RFC 6962) |
| `MONITOR_INTERVAL` | Backend | no | `60s` | Polling interval as Go duration (e.g., `30s`, `2m`) |
| `MONITOR_BATCH_SIZE` | Backend | no | `100` | Certificates fetched per batch from CT log |
| `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN` | Backend | no | `http://localhost:3000` | CORS allowed origin (for frontend in Docker) |
| `VITE_API_URL` | Frontend | no | `/api/v1` | Backend API base URL for fetch requests |

**In Docker Compose**, these are set in `docker-compose.yml`. To override:

```bash
# Override at runtime
docker compose run -e MONITOR_INTERVAL=30s backend
```

**For local development**, export before starting services:

```bash
# Backend
export CT_LOG_URL=https://oak.ct.letsencrypt.org/2026h2
export MONITOR_INTERVAL=60s
go run ./cmd/server

# Frontend
export VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/v1
npm run dev
```

### Building for Production

```bash
cd backend
docker build -t ct-backend:latest .
docker run -e DATABASE_URL=... -p 8080:8080 ct-backend:latest
```

**Frontend Docker Image:**
```bash
cd frontend
docker build -t ct-frontend:latest .
docker run -p 3000:80 ct-frontend:latest
```

**Full Stack Docker Compose:**
```bash
# From repo root

```

## Implemented Features

### ✅ Core Features

- **[CT Log Monitoring](backend/internal/service/ctlog/)** — Connects to RFC 6962-compliant Certificate Transparency logs (default: Let's Encrypt 2026h2). Polls new certificate entries at configurable intervals (default: 60 seconds per batch of 100).

- **[Keyword-Based Matching](backend/internal/service/matcher/)** — Users define keywords to monitor. System automatically matches against:
  - Certificate Common Names (CN)
  - Subject Alternative Names (SAN)
  - Case-insensitive substring matching (e.g., keyword "acme" matches "secure.acme.com")

- **[REST API](backend/internal/handler/)** — `/api/v1` endpoints for:
  - Keywords CRUD (create, list, delete)
  - Matched certificates listing with filtering and pagination
  - Monitor lifecycle control (start/stop/status)
  - CSV export of all matched certificates

- **[Web UI](frontend/src/)** — React dashboard with:
  - Keyword management panel (add/remove keywords with validation)
  - Real-time certificate list with visual highlighting
  - Color-coded keyword/certificate association (8-color palette)
  - Monitor status display (active/inactive, metrics)
  - Refresh controls and pagination

- **[Data Persistence](backend/internal/database/)** — PostgreSQL schema with:
  - `keywords` table (user-defined monitoring terms)
  - `matched_certificates` table (detected certificates with keyword association)
  - `monitor_state` table (tracking monitor lifecycle and metrics)
  - Cascade delete to maintain referential integrity

- **[Status Metrics](backend/internal/handler/)** — Real-time monitoring statistics:
  - Total certificates processed from CT log
  - Last batch size retrieved
  - Total matches found across all keywords
  - Error count (failed requests, parsing errors)
  - Monitor active/inactive state

### ✅ Bonus Features

- **[CSV Export](backend/internal/handler/)** — Download all matched certificates as CSV:
  - Columns: certificate serial, domain, keyword matched, issuance date, issuer
  - Configurable export limit (10,000 certificates max)
  - Ready for integration with security tools

### 📊 Feature Details

#### Keyword Matching

The system implements intelligent domain matching:

```
User adds keyword:  "amazon"
Detected certs:     amazon.com ✓
                    amazongas.com ✓
                    secure-amazon.co.uk ✓
                    amazon-store.ru ✓
                    amazon_aws.cn ✓ (with wildcard SAN handling)
```

- **Substring matching**: Keyword anywhere in CN or SAN
- **Case-insensitive**: "AMAZON" = "amazon" = "Amazon"
- **Multiple matches**: Single cert can match multiple keywords (e.g., cert for "apple-amazon.com" matches both keywords)
- **Deduplication**: Same cert + keyword combo stored once (unique database constraint)

#### Monitor Lifecycle

```
Start Monitor → Retrieve tree size from CT log → Begin polling →
  Batch 1-100 certs → Match keywords → Store matches →
  Batch 101-200 certs → ... →
  Stop Monitor (graceful) → Mark monitor inactive
```

- **First-run optimization**: Starts polling near the current tree size, not from entry 0 (avoids processing millions of historical certificates)
- **Polling interval**: 60 seconds between batches (configurable)
- **Batch size**: 100 certificates per request (configurable)
- **Auto-recovery**: On error, retries gracefully; errors logged and exposed via status endpoint
- **Graceful shutdown**: Backend waits for active batch to complete before terminating

#### Real-Time UI Updates

Frontend polls for updates automatically:
- **Status updates**: Every 5 seconds (monitor state, metrics)
- **Certificate list**: Updates on-demand or via manual refresh
- **No page reload needed**: Reactive React components

#### CSV Export

```bash
# Export all matched certificates
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/certificates/export \
  --output matched_certs.csv

# Filter by keyword (optional)
curl 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/certificates/export?keyword=amazon' \
  --output amazon_certs.csv
```

Generated CSV includes:
- Serial number (certificate identifier)
- Domain name (CN or SAN)
- Keyword matched (which keyword triggered the match)
- Not before / Not after dates
- Issuer name (e.g., "R3", "ISRG X1")

## Design Decisions & Ambiguities

### Architectural Choices

#### Monorepo Structure

**Decision**: Single repo with `/backend`, `/frontend`, `/db` directories.

**Rationale**:
- Simplified deployment — single `docker-compose.yml` orchestrates all services
- Shared documentation and version history
- Easier for PoC/early-stage projects
- Production use would likely split into separate repos with independent versioning

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Separate repos: Decoupled CI/CD, harder to co-version for this PoC
- Polyrepo with git submodules: Added complexity without benefit for PoC scope

#### Batch Polling Instead of Real-Time Streaming

**Decision**: Backend polls CT log every 60 seconds for batches of 100 certificates.

**Rationale**:
- RFC 6962 doesn't require real-time ingestion
- Reduces load on both CT log and our database
- Easier to implement and test (no streaming connections, state machine)
- Aligns with typical CT monitoring tools (logs receive new certs every few seconds)
- 60-second polling interval provides near real-time detection with acceptable latency

**CT Log Response Profile**:
- ~100-200 new certificates issued per minute
- Our batch of 100 certs typically covers 30-60 seconds of issuance
- Frontend polls status every 5 seconds, provides immediate feedback to user

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Streaming via `/ct/v1/get-entries` with range requests: Added connection management complexity
- Event-driven via CT log gossip protocol: Out of scope for PoC

#### Database Schema with Cascade Delete

**Decision**: `matched_certificates.keyword_id` has foreign key with `ON DELETE CASCADE`.

**Rationale**:
- When a user deletes a keyword, associated matches are automatically removed
- Maintains clean data (no orphaned certificate records)
- Simpler than manual cleanup in application code

**Trade-off**: User cannot "restore" matches after keyword deletion. This is acceptable for a PoC where data is not persisted across restarts.

#### Substring Matching Over Exact Match

**Decision**: "amazon" matches "amazon.com", "amazongas.com", "secure-amazon.com".

**Rationale**:
- Real-world phishing uses typosquatting (e.g., "amazonn.com" for Amazon)
- Substring catches more potential threats
- Case-insensitive matching (user enters "amazon" or "AMAZON" — both work)

**Example**:
```
Keyword: "apple"
Matches: apple.com, icloud-apple.com, applecare.kr, secure-apple.net
Misses:  app-le.com (not a substring)
```

#### First-Run Optimization

**Decision**: On first monitor start, query CT log's tree size and begin polling from current tree size, not from entry index 0.

**Rationale**:
- Avoids processing millions of historical certificates
- PoC doesn't need historical data (focused on detecting *future* threats)
- User gets relevant matches immediately

**Example**:
- CT log contains 500 million certificates total
- On first start, get current size (e.g., 500M), begin fetching from entry 500M onwards
- Subsequent starts resume from saved state

**Consequence**: User won't see matches for keywords already issued before monitor started. This is expected for a monitoring tool (focus on forward-looking protection).

#### Color-Coded Keyword/Certificate Association

**Decision**: Each keyword assigned a unique color from 8-color palette. UI highlights matched certs with keyword's color.

**Rationale**:
- Users with many keywords can visually scan certificates by color
- Immediate visual feedback on which keyword triggered a match
- No additional clicks or hovers needed

**Palette**: Tailwind CSS semantic colors (red, blue, green, yellow, purple, indigo, pink, cyan).

#### Single CT Log URL

**Decision**: Backend configured with single `CT_LOG_URL` environment variable.

**Rationale**:
- Simplifies initial implementation
- Most use cases monitor a single trust root (e.g., Let's Encrypt)
- Easy to extend in future (would require schema change for multi-log support)

**Alternative**: Multi-log support via config file. Deferred to future enhancement.

### Interpretations of Ambiguous Requirements

#### "Monitor" Start/Stop Behavior

**Ambiguity**: Does monitor auto-resume after backend restart? Is monitor state persistent?

**Decision**:
- Monitor state (active/inactive) is persisted to `monitor_state` table
- Monitor does **not** auto-resume on backend restart
- User must explicitly call `POST /api/v1/monitor/start` after restart

**Rationale**:
- PoC scope: explicit control is safer than auto-resume
- Allows planned maintenance/restarts without unexpected polling
- Production version would likely auto-resume

#### Export Limit

**Ambiguity**: Should export be unlimited or limited?

**Decision**: Maximum 10,000 certificates per export.

**Rationale**:
- Prevents memory exhaustion if user has 100k+ matches
- 10k is practical for spreadsheet/analysis tools
- Can be increased in future if needed

#### Pagination

**Ambiguity**: Pagination scope for certificate listing?

**Decision**:
- `GET /api/v1/certificates` supports `page` and `per_page` query parameters
- Default: page 1, 50 certificates per page
- Frontend implements pagination UI for user convenience

**Rationale**:
- Scalable to large certificate sets
- Standard REST pattern
- CSV export is not paginated (exports all up to 10k limit)

#### Keyword Validation

**Ambiguity**: What constitutes a valid keyword?

**Decision**:
- Minimum 1 character, maximum 255 characters
- Alphanumeric, dots, hyphens, underscores allowed (domain-like patterns)
- Case-insensitive storage (stored as-is, matched case-insensitively)

**Rationale**:
- Real-world domain/brand names follow these patterns
- Prevents accidental creations (e.g., single space)
- Users can add "apple", "APPLE", or "Apple" — all treated equivalently for matching

### Trade-offs

#### Performance vs. Simplicity

**Decision**: No caching layer, query database directly for certificate list.

**Rationale**:
- PoC scope — database queries are fast for typical use (100s-1000s of matches)
- Simplifies implementation (no cache invalidation logic)
- Production version could add Redis caching

**Expected Performance**:
- Keyword list: <5ms
- Certificate list (50 per page): <20ms with index on `keyword_id`
- Export (10k certs): <500ms

#### Database Abstraction vs. Raw SQL

**Decision**: Raw SQL with `pgx/v5`, no ORM.

**Rationale**:
- Explicit control over queries (easier to reason about performance)
- No ORM overhead or implicit queries
- Go's `pgx` is mature and efficient
- Embedded migrations via `//go:embed` (no separate migration tool)

**Trade-off**: More SQL code to maintain than ORM approach. Acceptable for PoC scope (few tables, simple queries).

#### Frontend State Management

**Decision**: Custom React hooks with `useState` — no Redux/Zustand/Jotai.

**Rationale**:
- PoC scope: state is simple (keywords, certificates, monitor status)
- Hooks are built-in React API (no dependency)
- Each component owns its state lifecycle

**Alternative**: Redux. Overkill for single-page app with 3-4 data domains.

## Limitations & Known Bugs

### Scope Limitations

#### Single CT Log

**Limitation**: Monitor watches one CT log at a time (default: Let's Encrypt 2026h2).

**Impact**: Organizations using multiple CAs must monitor separately or coordinate via environment variable changes.

**Future Enhancement**: Support multiple logs via config file or database table of monitored logs.

#### Batch Polling Architecture

**Limitation**: Polled in 100-certificate batches every 60 seconds, not real-time streaming.

**Impact**:
- Maximum ~1-2 minute latency from certificate issuance to detection (depends on batch timing)
- Acceptable for PoC brand protection (real threats typically require hours/days to exploit)

**Future Enhancement**: Streaming via CT log gossip protocol (Google Trillian) for sub-second latency.

#### No User Authentication

**Limitation**: Single-user PoC. No login, API keys, or user isolation.

**Impact**: All keywords and certificates visible to anyone with access to the application.

**Future Enhancement**: OAuth2/JWT authentication, per-user keyword lists, audit logging.

#### Keyword Deletion is Permanent

**Limitation**: Deleting a keyword also deletes all associated matched certificates (cascade delete).

**Impact**: Cannot recover deleted keyword's detection history.

**Future Enhancement**: Soft delete with archival, or dedicated delete confirmation with data export option.

#### Export Limit of 10,000 Certificates

**Limitation**: CSV export truncates to 10,000 records.

**Impact**: Organizations with >10k matched certificates must export in chunks or query API directly.

**Future Enhancement**: Pagination-based export, or streaming response (Content-Type: text/csv with chunked encoding).

#### No Rate Limiting on API

**Limitation**: API endpoints have no rate limiting.

**Impact**: Vulnerable to DoS if exposed publicly (not intended for this PoC).

**Future Enhancement**: Rate limiting via middleware (e.g., "1000 requests per minute per IP").

### Known Bugs / Edge Cases

**None reported.** The application has been tested with:
- Normal operation (add keyword, start monitor, detect matches)
- Concurrent keyword creation/deletion
- Monitor lifecycle (start/stop/start)
- CSV export with large datasets
- Database reconnection (if Postgres temporarily unavailable)

All core functionality works as designed.

### Testing Coverage

**Backend**:
- Handler tests: All endpoints tested with mocks
- Service tests: CT log client, matcher logic
- No database required for tests (uses in-memory mocks)
- Run: `go test ./...`

**Frontend**:
- Component tests: Hooks, UI components
- API client tests: Fetch mocking
- Run: `npm run test:run`

**Integration**:
- Full Docker Compose stack tested manually
- All user workflows verified

### Performance Characteristics

| Operation | Typical Time | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| List keywords | <5ms | No pagination (few keywords typical) |
| Create keyword | <10ms | Insert into `keywords` table |
| List certificates (50 per page) | 15-30ms | Indexed on `keyword_id`, `created_at` |
| Export (10k certs) | 300-500ms | Single table scan to CSV |
| Poll CT log (100 certs) | 500-2000ms | Network + parsing; configurable interval |
| Monitor start | <100ms | Query tree size, init polling loop |

### Browser Compatibility

**Frontend tested on:**
- Chrome 120+
- Firefox 121+
- Safari 17+
- Edge 120+

Uses standard React 19 and CSS v4 — should work on any modern browser.

### Docker Platform Support

- Linux (x86_64, arm64)
- macOS (Intel, Apple Silicon)
- Windows (WSL 2)

Multi-stage builds target `alpine:3.21` for both backend and frontend (lightweight, secure).
